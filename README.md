# F1-Explorative-Analysis
The high speeds and the brake neck overtakes at some of the most notorious corners in racing. The sheer adrenaline of watching someone extract every single unit of the power from the engine and the level of tech and engineering that is poured into these cars makes F1 a brilliant sport. The Williams of 1992, with which Nigel Mansel swept the competition apart, was primarily due to the car maker inventing a groundbreaking suspension technology that would adapt based on different road conditions. From intricate technologies like active suspension to the unsophisticated nature of rear-view mirrors and steering wheel buttons, F1's engineering has enabled us to experience some of these in our road cars, making them a lot of efficient, safer and faster. 

An explorative analysis of F1 to break down some historical data on circuits, drivers and racing data to understand what makes them the best or the worst.
